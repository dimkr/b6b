# Overview

**b6b** is a simple, dynamic, procedural and reflective scripting language inspired by [Tcl](http://www.tcl.tk/), [CPython](http://www.python.org/), Lisp, shell scripting and various ideas or views in western philosophy.

**b6b** follows five design principles:

1. Everything is an object
2. Every object is a string
3. Every object is a procedure
4. Every statement is a procedure call
5. Transparent parallelism

# Use Cases

**b6b** is especially useful as:

1. A more powerful, yet simple alternative to shell scripting
2. A thin layer above C and system calls, which provides exceptions, garbage collection and a dynamic type system
3. An embedded interpreter in a big software project
4. An extremely lightweight scripting language, for rapid development of fault-tolerant embedded software
