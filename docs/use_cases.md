**b6b** is especially useful as:

1. A more powerful, yet simple alternative to shell scripting
2. A thin layer above C and system calls, which provides exceptions, garbage collection and a dynamic type system
3. An embedded interpreter in a big software project
4. An extremely lightweight scripting language, for rapid development of fault-tolerant embedded software
