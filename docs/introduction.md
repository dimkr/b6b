**b6b** is a simple, dynamic, procedural and reflective scripting language inspired by [Tcl](http://www.tcl.tk/), [CPython](http://www.python.org/), Lisp, shell scripting and various ideas or views in western philosophy.

**b6b** follows five design principles:

1. Everything is an object
2. Every object is a string
3. Every object is a procedure
4. Every statement is a procedure call
5. Transparent parallelism
