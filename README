Overview
========

b6b is a tiny, embeddable scripting engine.

It is named so in admiration of the excellent Vincent Bach 6B trumpet
mouthpiece, which produces compact, yet lively and expressive tone with a
strong, solid core, that makes it a good choice for many playing situations. The
name was chosen with hope that these qualities will also be attributed to the
language and its implementation.

Building
========

  $ meson build
  $ ninja -C build
